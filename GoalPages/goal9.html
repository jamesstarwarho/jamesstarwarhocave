                Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster
                innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in
                infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress. In the face of a rapidly
                changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include
                industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and second, is
                supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, global manufacturing – considered an engine of
                overall economic growth – has been steadily declining due to tariffs and trade tensions. The
                manufacturing decline caused by the pandemic has further caused serious impacts on the global economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is primarily due to high inflation, energy price shocks, persistent disruptions in the supply of
                raw materials and intermediate goods, and global economic deceleration.
              </p>
              <p>
                While LDCs in Asia have made considerable progress, African LDCs would need to change the current
                trajectory and accelerate progress significantly to attain the target by 2030. However, medium-high and
                high-technology industries demonstrated robust growth rates.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How much progress have we made?
              </h3>
              <p>
                As of 2022, 95 per cent of the world’s population was within reach of a mobile broadband network, but
                some areas remain underserved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Investment in research and development globally – as well as financing for economic infrastructure in
                developing countries – has increased, and impressive progress has been made in mobile connectivity with
                almost the entire world population (97 per cent) living within reach of a mobile cellular signal.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What needs to be done?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication
                technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many
                countries. To achieve Goal 9 by 2030, it is also essential to support LDCs, invest in advanced
                technologies, lower carbon emissions and increase mobile broadband access.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Why should I care?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash
                dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in
                introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient
                use of resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. If industries
                pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What is the price of inaction?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The price is steep. Ending poverty would be more difficult, given the industry’s role as a core driver
                of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty and advance sustainable development. Additionally,
                failing to improve infrastructure and promote technological innovation could translate into poor health
                care, inadequate sanitation and limited access to education.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How can we help?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably
                managed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Collaborate with NGOs and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing
                countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think about how industry impacts on your life and well-being and use social media to push for
                policymakers to prioritize the SDGs.

                  The manufacturing industry’s recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic remains
                  incomplete and uneven. Global manufacturing growth slowed down to 3.3 per cent in 2022, from 7.4 per
                  cent in 2021. Progress in least developed countries (LDCs) is far from sufficient to reach the target
                  of doubling the manufacturing share in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. However, medium-high- and
                  high-technology industries demonstrated robust growth rates.

                  Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes grew by 0.9 per
                  cent to a new all-time high of 36.8 billion metric tons, well below global GDP growth, reverting to a
                  decade- long trend of decoupling emissions and economic growth.

                  Global expenditure on research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP increased from 1.69% in
                  2015 to 1.93% in 2020. The number of researchers per million inhabitants has increased worldwide from
