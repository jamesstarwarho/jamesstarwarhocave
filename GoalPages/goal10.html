                Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys
                people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population had been growing faster than the national
                average in most countries. But emerging yet inconclusive evidence suggests that COVID-19 may have put a
                dent in this positive trend of falling within-country inequality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pandemic has caused the largest rise in between-country inequality in three decades. Reducing both
                within- and between-country inequality requires equitable resource distribution, investing in education
                and skills development, implementing social protection measures, combating discrimination, supporting
                marginalized groups and fostering international cooperation for fair trade and financial systems.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Why do we need to reduce inequalities?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion
                and opportunity continue to persist across the world. Inequality threatens long-term social and economic
                development, harms poverty reduction and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. This, in
                turn, can breed crime, disease and environmental degradation.
              </p>
              <p>
                We cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from
                the chance for a better life.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What are some examples of inequality?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Women and children with lack of access to healthcare die each day from preventable diseases such as
                measles and tuberculosis or in childbirth. Older persons, migrants and refugees face lack of
                opportunities and discrimination – an issue that affects every country in the world. One in five persons
                reported being discriminated on at least one ground of discrimination prohibited by international human
                rights law.
              </p>
              <p>
                One in six people worldwide has experienced discrimination in some form, with women and people with
                disabilities disproportionately affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discrimination has many intersecting forms, from religion, ethnicity to gender and sexual preference,
                pointing to the urgent need for measures to tackle any kind of discriminatory practices and hate speech.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How do we tackle discrimination?
              </h3>
              <p>
                In today’s world, we are all interconnected. Problems and challenges like poverty, climate change,
                migration or economic crises are never just confined to one country or region. Even the richest
                countries still have communities living in abject poverty. The oldest democracies still wrestle with
                racism, homophobia and transphobia, and religious intolerance. Global inequality affects us all, no
                matter who we are or where we are from.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Can we achieve equality for everyone?
              </h3>
              <p>
                It can – and should be – achieved to ensure a life of dignity for all. Political, economic and social
                policies need to be universal and pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged and
                marginalized communities.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What can we do?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Reducing inequality requires transformative change. Greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme
                poverty and hunger, and invest more in health, education, social protection and decent jobs especially
                for young people, migrants and refugees and other vulnerable communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. We can
                ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws, policies
                and practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision-making
                on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including
                through planned and well-managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking
                better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration.
