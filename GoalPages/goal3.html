                Great strides have been made in improving people’s health in recent years. 146 out of 200 countries or
                areas have already met or are on track to meet the SDG target on under-5 mortality. Effective HIV
                treatment has cut global AIDS-related deaths by 52 per cent since 2010 and at least one neglected
                tropical disease has been eliminated in 47 countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, inequalities in health care access still persist. The COVID-19 pandemic and other ongoing
                crises have impeded progress towards Goal 3. Childhood vaccinations have experienced the largest decline
                in three decades, and tuberculosis and malaria deaths have increased compared with pre-pandemic levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis,
                malaria and other communicable diseases by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage, and
                provide access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all.
              </p>
              <p>
                To overcome these setbacks and address long-standing health care shortcomings, increased investment in
                health systems is needed to support countries in their recovery and build resilience against future
                health threats.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Access to essential health services
              </h3>
              <p>
                A significant portion of the global population still lacks access to vital healthcare services. To
                bridge this gap and ensure equitable healthcare provision, addressing disparities is critical. Various
                determinants of health, including environmental and commercial factors, need attention to pave the way
                for achieving our common objective of Health for All and achieving the Sustainable Development Goal
                targets.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How can we achieve these targets?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Healthy
                people are the foundation for healthy economies. Countries worldwide are urged to take immediate and
                decisive actions to predict and counteract health challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                This becomes especially critical in safeguarding vulnerable population groups and individuals residing
                in regions burdened by high disease prevalence. By doing so, we can strengthen health systems and foster
                resilience in the face of health adversities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Immunization is one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. However, the
                alarming decline in childhood vaccination – the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in
                approximately 30 years – is leaving millions of children at risk from devastating but preventable
                diseases.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Does everyone have access to healthcare?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Universal health coverage (UHC) aims to ensure that everyone can access quality health services without
                facing financial hardship. While efforts to combat infectious diseases like HIV, TB and malaria led to
                significant expansions in service coverage between 2000 and 2015, progress has since slowed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inequalities continue to be a fundamental challenge for UHC. Coverage of reproductive, maternal, child
                and adolescent health services tends to be higher among those whoare richer, more educated, and living
                in urban areas, especially in low-income countries.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What can I do to help?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making
                well-informed choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as
                well as people’s right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women
                and children.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also hold your government, local leaders and other decision-makers accountable to their
                commitments to improve people access to health and health care.

                  However, insufficient progress has been made in other areas, such as on reducing maternal mortality
                  and expanding universal health coverage. Globally, approximately 800 women died every day from
                  pregnancy
                  or childbirth in 2020. And 381 million people were pushed or further pushed into extreme poverty in
                  2019 due to out-of-pocket payments for health.
