                Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiple crises are placing the global economy under serious threat. Global real GDP per capita growth
                is forecast to slow down in 2023 and with ever increasing challenging economic conditions, more workers
                are turning to informal employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased. However, more
                progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal
                employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and
                secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive
                economic growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The global unemployment rate declined significantly in 2022, falling to 5.4 per cent from a peak of 6.6
                per cent in 2020 as economies began recovering from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rate was
                lower than the pre-pandemic level of 5.5 per cent in 2019.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What does “decent work” mean?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income,
                security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development
                and social integration. A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and
                under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that
                all must share in progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What are the challenges?
              </h3>
              <p>
                A persistent lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption
                contribute to the erosion of the basic social contract: that all must share in progress. The creation of
                quality jobs remain a major challenge for almost all economies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Achieving Goal 8 will require a wholesale reform of the financial system to tackle rising debts,
                economic uncertainty and trade tensions, while promoting equitable pay and decent work for young people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve
                living standards.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How many people are unemployed?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The estimated total global unemployment in 2022 was 192 million. Projections indicate that global
                unemployment is expected to decrease further to 5.3 per cent in 2023, equivalent to 191 million people.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pandemic disproportionately affected women and youth in labour markets. Women experienced a stronger
                recovery in employment and labour force participation than men.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, young people aged 15–24 continue to face severe difficulties in securing decent employment, and
                the global youth in 2022, unemployment rate is much higher than the rate for adults aged 25 and above.
                Globally, nearly 1 in 4 young people – 289 million – were not in education, employment or training.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What can we do to fix these issues?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and
                training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands,
                giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as
                leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of
                their gender, income level or socio-economic background.
              </p>
              <p>
                Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting
                youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implementing adequate health and safety measures and promoting supportive working environments are
                fundamental to protecting the safety of workers, especially relevant for health workers and those
                providing essential services.

                  However, the youth unemployment rate continues to be much higher than the rate for adults, indicating

                  The slowdown in global growth in 2023 is likely to be less severe than previously expected, mainly due
                  to resilient household spending in the developed economies and recovery in China. Global economic
                  growth is now projected to reach 2.3 per cent in 2023, an upward revision by 0.4 percentage points
