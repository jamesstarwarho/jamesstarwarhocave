              <p>
                Eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 is a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for
                Sustainable Development. Extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per person per day at
                2017 purchasing power parity, has witnessed remarkable declines over recent decades.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, the emergence of COVID-19 marked a turning point, reversing these gains as the number of
                individuals living in extreme poverty increased for the first time in a generation by almost 90 million
                over previous predictions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even prior to the pandemic, the momentum of poverty reduction was slowing down. By the end of 2022,
                nowcasting suggested that 8.4 per cent of the world’s population, or as many as 670 million people,
                could still be living in extreme poverty. This setback effectively erased approximately three years of
                progress in poverty alleviation.
              </p>

              <p>
                If current patterns persist, an estimated 7% of the global population – around 575 million people –
                could still find themselves trapped in extreme poverty by 2030, with a significant concentration in
                sub-Saharan Africa.
              </p>

              <p>
                A shocking revelation is the resurgence of hunger levels to those last observed in 2005. Equally
                concerning is the persistent increase in food prices across a larger number of countries compared to the
                period from 2015 to 2019. This dual challenge of poverty and food security poses a critical global
                concern.
              </p>

              <h3>Why is there so much poverty?</h3>
              <p>
                Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high
                vulnerability
                of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being
                productive.
              </p>

              <h3>Why should I care about other people’s economic situation?</h3>
              <p>
                There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our well- being is linked to each other.
                Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increas- ing
                political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.
              </p>

              <h3>Why is social protection so important?</h3>
              <p>
                Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and preventing many people
                from
                falling into poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic had both immediate and long-term economic consequences for
                people across the globe – and despite the expansion of social protection during the COVID-19 crisis, 55
                per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – are entirely unprotected.
              </p>

              <p>
                In response to the cost-of-living crisis, 105 countries and territories announced almost 350 social
                protection measures between February 2022 and February 2023. Yet 80 per cent of these were short-term in
                nature, and to achieve the Goals, countries will need to implement nationally appropriate universal and
                sustainble social protection systems for all.
              </p>

              <h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
              <p>
                Your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in addressing poverty. It ensures that your
                rights are promoted and that your voice is heard, that inter-generational knowledge is shared, and that
                innovation and critical thinking are encouraged at all ages to support transformational change in
                people’s
                lives and communities.
              </p>

              <p>
                Governments can help create an enabling environment to generate pro- productive employment and job
                opportunities for the poor and the marginalized.
              </p>

              <p>
                The private sector has a major role to play in determining whether the growth it creates is inclusive
                and
                contributes to poverty reduction. It can promote economic opportunities for the poor.
              </p>

              <p>
                The contribution of science to end poverty has been significant. For example, it has enabled access to
                safe drinking water, reduced deaths caused by water-borne diseases, and improved hygiene to reduce
                health
                risks related to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation.

                  entirely unprotected. Many of the world’s vulnerable population groups, including the young and the
