              <p>
                Goal 14 is about conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources. Healthy oceans
                and seas are essential to human existence and life on Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ocean is intrinsic to our life on earth. Covering three-quarters of the Earth’s surface, contain 97
                percent of the Earth’s water, and represent 99 percent of the living space on the planet by volume.
              </p>
              <p>
                They provide key natural resources including food, medicines, biofuels and other products; help with the
                breakdown and removal of waste and pollution; and their coastal ecosystems act as buffers to reduce
                damage from storms. They also act as the planet’s greatest carbon sink.
              </p>
              <p>
                Worryingly, marine pollution is reaching extreme levels, with over 17 million metric tons clogging the
                ocean in 2021, a figure set to double or triple by 2040. Plastic is the most harmful type of ocean
                pollution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, the ocean’s average pH is 8.1 which is about 30 per cent more acidic than in pre- industrial
                times. Ocean acidification threatens the survival of marine life, disrupts the food web, and undermines
                vital services provided by the ocean and our own food security.
              </p>
              <p>
                Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future. This
                includes increasing funding for ocean science, intensifying conservation efforts, and urgently turning
                the tide on climate change to safeguard the planet’s largest ecosystem. Current efforts to protect are
                not yet meeting the urgent need to safeguard this vast, yet fragile, resource.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Why?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The ocean is our planet’s life support and regulate the global climate system. It is the world’s largest
                ecosystem, home to nearly a million known species and containing vast untapped potential for scientific
                discovery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oceans and fisheries continue to support the global population’s economic, social and environmental
                needs. Despite the critical importance of conserving oceans, decades of irresponsible exploitation have
                led to an alarming level of degradation.
              </p>
              <h3>
                So what’s the problem?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The ocean absorbs around 23 per cent of annual CO2 emissions generated by human activity and helps
                mitigate the impacts of climate change. The ocean has also absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in
                the climate system. Ocean heat is at record levels, causing widespread marine heatwaves, threatening its
                rich eco-systems and killing coral reefs around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Increasing levels of debris in the world’s oceans are also having a major environmental and economic
                impact. Every year, an estimated 5 to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic enters the ocean, costing
                roughly $13 billion per year – including clean-up costs and financial losses in fisheries and other
                industries. About 89% of plastic litter found on the ocean floor are single-use items like plastic bags.
              </p>
              <p>
                About 80% of all tourism takes place in coastal areas. The ocean-related tourism industry grows an
                estimated US$ 134 billion per year and in some countries, the industry already supports over a third of
                the labour force.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless carefully managed, tourism can pose a major threat to the natural resources on which it depends,
                and to local culture and industry.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How is the ocean connected to our health?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The health of the ocean is intimately tied to our health. The diversity of species found in the ocean
                offers great promise for pharmaceuticals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, marine fisheries provide 57 million jobs globally and provide the primary source of protein
                to over 50% of the population in least developed countries.
              </p>
              <h3>
                So, what can we do?
              </h3>
              <p>
                For open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international
                cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats. Establishing complete, effective and equitably managed
                systems of government-protected areas should be pursued to conserve bio-diversity and ensure a
                sustainable future for the fishing industry. One example is the Biodiversity Beyond National
                Jurisdiction Agreement in 2023 that provides a legal framework for all activities in the ocean and seas.
              </p>
              <p>
                On a local level, we should make ocean- friendly choices when buying products or eating food derived
                from oceans and consume only what we need. Reducing our plastic use is critical.

                  The ocean is in a state of emergency as increasing eutrophication, acidification, ocean warming and
                  plastic pollution worsen its health. Additionally, the alarming trend of overfishing persists, leading
                  to the depletion of over one third of global fish stocks.

                <p></p>
                <li>
                  While there has been some progress in expanding marine protected areas, combating illegal, unreported
                  and unregulated fishing, banning fishing subsidies and supporting small-scale fishers, action is not
                  advancing at the speed or scale required to meet Goal 14.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  To counter these trends, swift and coordinated global action is imperative. This entails increasing
                  funding for ocean science, intensifying conservation efforts, advancing nature- and ecosystem-based
                  solutions, addressing the interconnections and impacts of human-induced pressures, and urgently
