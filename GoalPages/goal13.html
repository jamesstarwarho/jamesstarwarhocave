              <p>
                Every person, in every country in every continent will be impacted in some shape or form by climate
                change. There is a climate cataclysm looming, and we are underprepared for what this could mean.
              </p>
              <p>
                Climate change is caused by human activities and threatens life on earth as we know it. With rising
                greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated. Its impacts
                can be devastating and include extreme and changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                If left unchecked, climate change will undo a lot of the development progress made over the past years.
                It will also provoke mass migrations that will lead to instability and wars.
              </p>
              <p>
                To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre- industrial levels, emissions must already be decreasing and
                need to be cut by almost half by 2030, just seven years away. But, we are drastically off track from
                this target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Urgent and transformative going beyond mere plans and promises are crucial. It requires raising
                ambition, covering entire economies and moving towards climate-resilient development, while outlining a
                clear path to achieve net-zero emissions. Immediate measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic
                consequences and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Act Now
              </h3>
              <p>
                The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full commitment
                required for its reversal. 2010 – 2019 was the warmest decade ever recorded, bringing with it massive
                wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, floods and other climate disasters across continents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Climate change is disrupting national economies and affecting lives and livelihoods, especially for the
                most vulnerable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 2010 and 2020, highly vulnerable regions, home to approximately 3.3–3.6 billion people,
                experienced 15 x higher human mortality rates from floods, droughts and storms compared to regions with
                very low vulnerability.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What happens if you don’t take action?
              </h3>
              <p>
                If left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase beyond 3°C, and
                will adversely affect every ecosystem. Already, we are seeing how climate change can exacerbate storms
                and disasters, and threats such as food and water scarcity, which can lead to conflict. Doing nothing
                will end up costing us a lot more than if we take action now.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Solving the problem
              </h3>
              <p>
                To address climate change, we have to vastly raise our ambition at all levels. Much is happening around
                the world – investments in renewable energy have soared. But more needs to be done. The world must
                transform its energy, industry, transport, food, agriculture and forestry systems to ensure that we can
                limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C, maybe even 1.5°C. In December 2015, the world took a
                significant first step by adopting the Paris Agreement, in which all countries committed to take action
                to address climate change. However, more actions are critically needed in order to meet the targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Businesses and investors need to ensure emissions are lowered, not just because it is the right thing to
                do, but because it makes economic and business sense as well.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Are we investing enough to combat climate change?
              </h3>
              <p>
                According to the UNFCCC, global climate finance flows reached an annual average of $803 billion in
                2019–2020, a 12 per cent increase compared to prior years. However, this still falls short of the levels
                needed to limit warming, and fossil-fuel-related flows exceeded climate financing for adaptation and
                mitigation in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2019, at least 120 of the 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and
                implement National Adaptation Plans to enhance climate adaptation and resilience, an increase of 29
                countries over the previous year. Furthermore, progress in meeting the 2020 disaster risk reduction
                target has been slow.
              </p>

                  With a climate cataclysm looming, the pace and scale of current climate action plans are wholly
                  insufficient to effectively tackle climate change. Increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather
                  events are already impacting every region on Earth. Rising temperatures will escalate these hazards
                  further, posing grave risks.

                  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes that deep, rapid and sustained
                  reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are essential in all sectors, beginning now and
                  continuing throughout this decade. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre- industrial levels,
                  emissions must already be decreasing and need to be cut by almost half by 2030, just seven years away.
