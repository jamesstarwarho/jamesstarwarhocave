              <p>
                Goal 17 is about revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is
                universal and calls for action by all countries – developed and developing – to ensure no one is left
                behind. It requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sustainable Development Goals can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership
                and cooperation to ensure no one is left behind in our journey to development.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, not all countries are setting off from the same start line, and low and middle income countries
                are facing a tidal wave of debt which they are treading water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing countries are grappling with an unprecedented rise in external debt levels following the
                COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by challenges such as record inflation, escalating interest rates,
                competing priorities and constrained fiscal capacity, underscoring the urgent need for debt relief and
                financial assistance.
              </p>
              <p>
                While official development assistance (ODA) flows continue to reach record peaks, the increase in 2022
                is primarily attributed to spending on refugees in donor countries and aid to Ukraine.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be successful, everyone will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources, and developed
                countries will need to fulfill their official development assistance commitments.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Why?
              </h3>
              <p>
                In light of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that strengthening multilateralism
                and global partnerships are more important than ever if we are to solve the world’s problems.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Why does this matter to me?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 goals, is universal and calls for action by all
                countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure no one is left behind.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How much progress have we made?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Support for implementing the SDGs has been steady but fragile, with major and persistent challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                Financial resources remain scarce, trade tensions have been increasing, and crucial data are still
                lacking.
              </p>
              <p>
                A growing share of the global population has access to the Internet, and a Technology Bank for Least
                Developed Countries has been established, yet the digital divide persists.
              </p>
              <h3>
                As partners, what would we need to do to reach this?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources— technology development, financial
                resources, capacity building— and developed countries will need to fulfill their official development
                assistance commitments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multistakeholder partnerships will be crucial to leverage the inter-linkages between the Sustainable
                Development Goals to enhance their effectiveness and impact and accelerate progress in achieving the
                Goals.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How can we ensure the resources needed are effectively mobilized?
              </h3>
              <p>
                This will be primarily the responsibility of countries. Reviews of progress will need to be undertaken
                regularly in each country, involving civil society, business and representatives of various interest
                groups. At the regional level, countries will share experiences and tackle common issues, while on an
                annual basis, at the United Nations, the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF),
                they will take stock of progress at the global level, identifying gaps and emerging issues, and
                recommending corrective action.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What can we do to help?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Join/create a group in your local community that seeks to mobilize action on the implementation of the
                SDGs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Encourage your governments to partner with businesses for the implementation of the SDGs.

                  Geopolitical tensions and the resurgence of nationalism hinder international cooperation and
